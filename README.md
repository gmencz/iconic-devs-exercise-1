# Iconic Devs Exercise 1 - Gabriel Mendez

Full-Stack software application (supermarket checkout).

## Requirements:

- Node.JS v16 (at the time of writing this is the current LTS).
- Preferably Mac or Linux OS because of issues Windows might present during
  development since it's known for not working quite well with development unless using WSL.

## Technical description

I've chosen a number of technologies which I'm most comfortable with or simply prefer over other current technologies available since the technologies requirements weren't too strict.

### Back-end

Source code is in the `back` folder and contains the back-end of the application.

Technologies used:

- NodeJS
- TypeScript
- ExpressJS
- Jest
- Eslint
- Nodemon

### Front-end

Source code is in the `front` folder and contains the front-end of the application.

Technologies used:

- React
- Remix (React framework)
- Tailwind (CSS Framework)

## Local development.

1. Install dependencies with `npm install` in both `back/` and `front/`.
2. Run `npm run dev` in one terminal inside `back/` to run the development version of the back-end of the application.
3. Run `npm run dev` in one terminal inside `front/` to run the development version of the front-end of the application.
