# Iconic Devs Exercise 1 - Gabriel Mendez

Full-Stack software application (supermarket checkout).

- `back` contains the back-end of the application and it's written in NodeJS using TypeScript and [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/) as the web framework.
- `front` contains the front-end of the application and it's written in React using the [Remix](https://remix.run/) framework. The framework solves similar problems to the ones [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) solves but I've been using it more recently and personally prefer it over Next which is why I chose it for this project.
